idiom in C ?
construct in a language ? : straight forward | no special semantics
idion : uses the construct directly and has some special semantics based on the context
beyond this : pattern | rich semantics

binary search on an ordered list ?
 - log(n) comp ?
 - will this have linear traversals ?
 - do we require a doubly linked list ?



phase : functionality
pass : going over src code or modified version of it

How to run programs in C ?

Phase and not pass : 

	1. write the program and get a src file. (.c file)
	2. pre-process : translation unit (output)
	3. Input to compiler is translation unit. Then output from compiler is object file.
	4. Linker : puts number of object files together and libraries. Output of linker is loadable image.
	5. this is then loaded and transfered to memory of PC and then we get a process and then we run the program.


# serving each food item is phase, and walking through leaves is pass
# get container with multi parts : 


usually a pass has multiple phases

nm filename.o

# : pre processor directive ( a few r compiler directive pragma)
const, constexpr

introduce variable from command line using -D : i.e we r defining a preprocessor variable

```
gcc -DB=20 -c apple.c
```

PRE PROCESSOR 

#define A 10

table created at pre processing stage
conditional updates in pre processor var ?
pre processor does not understand scope
try cyclic or relational # defines : recursive , cascaded
virtual memory : helps relocation easy 
#if 0

#endif

#if 1

#endif

whenever we use inheritance with derived class constructor is non trivial we make destructor of base class virtual. Implied that derived class destrctr also virtual

upcasting ---> derived class to base class type --> trivial
down casting ---> base to derived ---> kuch hota hai
