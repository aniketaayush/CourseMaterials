What does this mean?
Subject is not coupled with Observer. Observer is coupled with the subject.

Why should notify be in the abstract subject class and not in concrete subject class?

Why should update on Observer send the subject to it?

Can the Observer hold the subject as a variation so that the update on Observer
	does not send the subject?
