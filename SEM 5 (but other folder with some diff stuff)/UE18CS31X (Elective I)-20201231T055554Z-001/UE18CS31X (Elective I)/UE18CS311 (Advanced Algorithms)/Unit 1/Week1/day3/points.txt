1. given a long sequence of 0 and 1, find where the first 1 occurs.
   length is not known.
   length cannot be computed
   can you use some technique like binary search?
   O(log n) algo?

2. given a sequence sorted and repeated elements, find the leftmost occurrence of a key.
   extend to find the range of elements with a given key. equal_range
   
3. given a matrix (M X N) with elements are arranged in order rowwise as well as column,
   search for an element
   
   
O(log(n, 2)) or O(log(n, 3))
O(2^log(n, 2)) or O(2^log(n, 3))

complexity:
is c : real or integer
should c be positive
can that be 0
can that be negative

is n real or integer
can n be 0
can n be negative

little theta?
