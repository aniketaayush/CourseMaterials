Turing Machine was invented by Alan Turing in 1936 and it is used to accept Recursive Enumerable Languages (generated by Type-0 Grammar).

A turing machine consists of a tape of infinite length on which read and writes operation can be performed. The tape consists of infinite cells on which each cell either contains input symbol or a special symbol called blank. It also consists of a head pointer which points to cell currently being read and it can move in both directions. A TM is expressed as a 7-tuple (Q, T, B, ∑, δ, q0, F) where:

Q is a finite set of states

T is the tape alphabet (symbols which can be written on Tape)

B is blank symbol (every cell is filled with B except input alphabet initially)

∑ is the input alphabet (symbols which are part of input alphabet)

δ is a transition function which maps Q × T → Q × T × {L,R}. Depending on its present state and present tape alphabet (pointed by head pointer), it will move to new state, change the tape symbol (may or may not) and move head pointer to either left or right.

q0 is the initial state

F is the set of final states. If any state of F is reached, input string is accepted.






SET OF OPR :

1) read, write, move  (if already at left end then stay there)

2) Halt accept / halt reject



TURING THESIS

it states that any computation that can be performed mechanically can be performed using a turning machine



Turing machine accepts recursively enumerable language

REL : A language L is called REL if there is a turing machine that accepts it exists.




Recursive language : A language L is said so if there exists a turing machine which accepts all languages in L and reject all not in L. turing machine will halt every time and give the ans. (no loopy)

Recursively enumerable : A language L such that a turing machine accepts n haults for all language in L but it may or may not hault for the ones not in L.
