Theory of Computation: A Problem-Solving Approach

RUNNABLE EXAMPLES

This folder contains JFLAP files (with the extension .jff) for the examples in various chapters of the book. 
All the finite automata, grammars, pushdown automata and Turing machine examples are included.

To run these examples, first install the standard edition of Java (jdk) and then the JFLAP package available
for download from www.jflap.org. An example can be loaded by changing to the folder where JFLAP is installed 
and running:

> java JFLAP

An interactive menu appears in which you can select the File menu and the Open option in it. Select the
particular jff file and open it.

Once open, you can not only see the automaton, you can run it in both Fast Run and Step modes under the 
Input menu by providing the desired input. In addition, various conversions can also be tried under the Convert
menu: NFA to DFA, DFA to RegEx, etc.

Of course, you can also construct your own automata and Turing machines using the graphical editor in JFLAP.

All the examples have been developed using JFLAP 7.0 running on jdk 1.6.

If you notice any bugs or other issues in the examples, please write to DrKaviMahesh@gmail.com
