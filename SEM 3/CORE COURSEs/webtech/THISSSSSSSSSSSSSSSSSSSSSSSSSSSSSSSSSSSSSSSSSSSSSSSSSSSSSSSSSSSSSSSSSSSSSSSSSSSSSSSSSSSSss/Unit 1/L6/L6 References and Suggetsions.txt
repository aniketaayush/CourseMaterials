Reference: These slides have been compiled from various source like textbooks,other ppts etc. You should be able to find most of these topics in any CSS book. 
Please note that CSS is in itself a vast topic and covering it in detail in a lecture is not possible. Our purpose is to simply introduce students to the idea of CSS. As fas as tests are concerned these slides define the scope for assessment. However I strongly recommend that you explore more on CSS in terms of conflict resolution and selectors in case this is your first time with CSS. Also we will be covering a few more selectors in Unit 5 when we do jQuery. If you are not able to complete selectors in one lecture please give out the material to the students and ask them to explore on their own. The will work on CSS during the project.
